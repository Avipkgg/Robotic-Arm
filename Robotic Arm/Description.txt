A robotic arm is a type of mechanical arm that is similar to the human arm. It has various segments which closely resemble the shoulder, an elbow, and a wrist. A robotic arm is programmable and can be directed to perform a variety of functions just like the human arm can. The main purpose of this project is to carry out a particular object and keep it in a required position.

Applications:
1. Picking and placing objects can be easily performed with the help gripper.
2. Robotic arms are used in manufacturing industries for assembling parts
3. ROS based Robotic Arm can be used in agriculture for performing tasks such as planting, harvesting and pruning.
